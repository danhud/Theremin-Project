# Overview

My goal for this project is to combine some rudimentary computer vision and 
audio signal processing packages to make a simple "theremin", which utilizes 
hand tracking and my webcam to produce a tone.  

## Version 1:

This is supposed to be a 'proof of concept', where I learn which packages to use 
in order to get my theremin to produce noise. As is stands there are many areas which I intend
to improve upon for Version 2.
